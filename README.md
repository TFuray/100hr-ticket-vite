## Ticket Style Team Managment App Built with MERN

This app was designed primarily to help the front of house and back of house work better individually and together. It shows what everyones responsibilities are 
within their teams as well as keeping communication between teams open. Having come from a background working both as a server and as a line cook I know
first hand how common it is to be a bit of a free for all between meals, and how little communication there can be between managers and staff, as well as between teams.
Also how smoothly a shift can go when everyone knows who's responsible for what. This project was designed to make that easier for everyone involved.
